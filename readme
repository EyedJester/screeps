This whole document is meant for the people who just so happen to stumble across my github page.

If you are looking through my code and think to yourself, "Wow, too many comments. Way WAY too many comments," then I'd agree. Yes,
I have much too many comments.

However, I use the comments as a refresher to myself after I inevitibly feel sorry for myself at not being better at programming,
and go into a rut of not programming for two weeks.

Cheers!
